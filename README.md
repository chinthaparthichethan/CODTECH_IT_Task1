Detailed Steps
Step 1: Firebase Project Setup
Create a Firebase Project:

Visit the Firebase Console and click "Add project" to initiate a new project.
Add Firebase to Your Web App:

In the Firebase console, choose your project, and click the web icon (</>) to create a web app.
Follow the prompts to integrate Firebase SDK into your web application.
Step 2: Authentication Setup
Enable Authentication Providers:

Navigate to the "Authentication" section in the Firebase console.
Enable the desired authentication methods (e.g., Email/Password, Google).
Implement Authentication in Your App:

Develop sign-up and sign-in forms.
